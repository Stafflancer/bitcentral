FUEL plugin imports fuel videos via MRSS feed and displays them on the front-end through short codes for its users.

== Description ==

The FUEL Plugin for WordPress was designed to make ingesting FUEL assets into WP relatively simple and reliable. It can be configured to automatically publish “posts” on your site in a ‘set it and forget’ model. FUEL videos assets that have titles [headlines] that translate to the web and whose selected thumbnails are relevant to the story can be published automatically to a web page using one of several ‘short codes’.

== 3rd Party or external service ==

The plugin uses our third party script to run the FUEL player;
